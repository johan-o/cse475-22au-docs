## Project Goal
We aim to give people data about the air they have been breathing. We want to give people the ability to see historical data about the quality and location of those measurements. Our measurement device will be a puck, with built-in air quality sensors (for particulates PM2.5), minimum one-day battery life, and a connection to your mobile phone that you carry.

## Value of project
In general, people do not actively care about indoor or outdoor air quality. Only when there are peculiar smells, physical discomfort, and mucous membrane irritation, will we pay attention to whether it is an air quality problem. And also if there is some bad news, people will think about whether it will happen to them. In fact, there are some people who don't care about air quality because they don't have access to visible data. The real-time data released by air quality monitoring will gradually develop people's habit of caring about the air quality of their environment, just like people's habit of checking the time or checking social media from time to time. With such a habit and the basis of environmental data, people will take the initiative to find ways to control air quality, thereby improving the health of the environment in which they live. This would be the significant value of the real-time monitoring of air quality.
