# Problem Space and Applications
As the climate changes, we have started to notice changes in the living quality of all people. We see
that for entire months of the year, forest fires cause a haze of smoke to descend and stay on Seattle.

We aim to give people data about the air they have been breathing. We want to give people the ability to see 
historical data about the quality and location of those measurements. Our measurement device will be a puck,
with built-in air quality sensors (for particulates PM2.5), minimum one-day battery life, and a connection 
to your mobile phone that you carry.

# Example Scenarios
An example scenario would be a person in a heavily air-polluted area being able to see historical data
over both time and location of air quality. The project should be able to create tracks of the data.

# Related Technology
[Purple Air](https://www2.purpleair.com/): Purple Air provides a similar service, aggregating data with static 
sensors that you can buy, aggregating data and serving it through both an API and a map.

# Potential Design Solutions

# Needed Resources
We anticipate that finding a low-power air quality sensor will be difficult (power, heat).
