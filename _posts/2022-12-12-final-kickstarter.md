## Project Goal
This project aims to give people some data about the air that they are breathing. In the Seattle area, 
the worst air pollution is often particulates such as those produced by wilfires or other fires. 
The Air Quality Monitor  gives the user the ability to see historical data about the air they have been breathing. 
This project provides two products: a portable puck with an air quality sensor able to measure the amounts of PM1.0, 
PM2.5, and PM10.0 contamination, and a phone app that pairs with the air sensor. Our goal is to have a minimum 
one-day battery life for the sensor, and the ability to see a track of the air quality data produced.

## Value of project
In general, people do not actively care about indoor or outdoor air quality. Only when there are peculiar smells, physical discomfort, and mucous membrane irritation, will we pay attention to whether it is an air quality problem. And also if there is some bad news, people will think about whether it will happen to them. In fact, there are some people who don't care about air quality because they don't have access to visible data. The real-time data released by air quality monitoring will gradually develop people's habit of caring about the air quality of their environment, just like people's habit of checking the time or checking social media from time to time. With such a habit and the basis of environmental data, people will take the initiative to find ways to control air quality, thereby improving the health of the environment in which they live. This would be the significant value of the real-time monitoring of air quality.
