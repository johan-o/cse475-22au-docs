# Summary
As we've learned over the past decade, air quality is an important quality-of-life metric. Though extensive air quality sensor networks exist, all are based on static sensors mounted on buildings. Our project provides a portable air quality monitor with one day of battery life, that provides a track of air quality where you have been.

# Deliverables
* A phone app that pairs with the air quality monitor, aggregating data and displaying it on a map
* An air quality monitor, capable of pairing to a mobile device with Bluetooth, and minimum one-day battery life

# Critical features
1. PM2.5 / Smoke Detection and AQI equivalent
1. Portable design
1. 1 Day Battery Life

# Performance Metrics
To make our sensor as effective as possible, we will try to maximize battery life, the accuracy of air quality readings, and durability.  Our target battery life is one day which will allow the user to recharge the device every night without needing to recharge during the day.  For the accuracy of the air quality readings, we will use the standard micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air.  The accuracy of our readings will depend on the quality of our sensors but we want to be able to differentiate between normal and elevated levels.  Our sensor also needs to be durable enough that walking with it and accidentally dropping it will not break or damage the sensor.

# Potential Risks

| Potential Risk                    | Mitigations             |
| ---                               | ---                |
| Semiconductor Shortage            | Choose an easily available MCU (ESP32), and try multiple air quality sensors | 
| Difficulty in getting components  | Order components from multiple suppliers, make design not dependent on a PCB |
