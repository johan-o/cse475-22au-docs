# Week 1
This week, we brainstormed the project ideas and find out the potential futures for the project.

# Week 2
We determined the software we would use for the website, wrote the first post on it, and 
wrote up the project proposal.

# Week 3
We chose and [ordered](https://www.amazon.com/DORHEA-Development-Microcontroller-NodeMCU-32S-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B0B18MCYFH/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=2Q40WM2LB1IN&keywords=esp32%2B4pcs&qid=1665704507&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=esp32%2B4pcs%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-3&th=1&psc=1) 
our MCU platform, the ESP32. Additionally, we found and ordered two air quality sensors: 
[Keyestudio](https://www.amazon.com/KEYESTUDIO-Particle-Monitor-Arduino-Raspberry/dp/B07B2PFPB5/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?crid=26DYWAHSC2TN6&keywords=keyestudio+pm2.5+dust+sensor&qid=1665705539&sprefix=keyestudio+pm2.5+dust+sensor%2Caps%2C208&sr=8-2) 
and the [PMS5003](https://www.amazon.com/BestParts-Digital-Particle-Concentration-PMS5003/dp/B0B1DQKV4N/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?keywords=pms5003&qid=1665705582&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjc4IiwicXNhIjoiMy40OCIsInFzcCI6IjMuNDMifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-3).
We started work on the PRD (Product Requirements Document), and assigned roles to everybody.
