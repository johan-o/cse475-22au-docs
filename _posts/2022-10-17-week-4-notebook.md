serial output**

Johan: Got sample code working with both sensors (PMS5003, analog sensor) with Arduino. Got PMS5003 reading data
on ESP32 after some work. Found that both sensors gave accurate data--metrics decreased significantly when
going outside into smokey air

Learning about the Phone app code.
Design and discuss the UI and functionality of the app.
